RSA vs AES: Performance and Use-Case Comparison
================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This document compares RSA (asymmetric cryptography) and AES-256 (symmetric cryptography)
based on the encryption/decryption demonstration performed on message.txt.

1. ALGORITHM TYPE
-----------------
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):
- Asymmetric (Public-Key) Cryptography
- Uses a key pair: public key for encryption, private key for decryption
- Based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers

AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard):
- Symmetric Cryptography
- Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption
- Based on substitution-permutation network principles

2. KEY MANAGEMENT
-----------------
RSA:
- Requires key pair generation (public and private keys)
- Public key can be shared openly; private key must be kept secret
- Key distribution is easier (no need for secure channel to share public key)
- Key size: 2048 bits (recommended minimum)

AES-256:
- Requires a single 256-bit (32-byte) key
- Key must be kept secret and shared securely between parties
- Key distribution is challenging (requires secure channel or key exchange protocol)
- Key size: 256 bits (fixed)

3. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------------------
RSA:
- SLOW for large data encryption/decryption
- Encryption is faster than decryption
- Limited data size per operation (max ~214 bytes for 2048-bit key with OAEP padding)
- For larger files, data must be split into chunks, significantly increasing processing time
- Computational complexity: O(n^3) where n is key size
- Best suited for small data or encrypting symmetric keys

AES-256:
- FAST for data encryption/decryption
- Symmetric operations (encryption and decryption are similar in speed)
- Can handle files of any size efficiently
- No size limitations per operation
- Computational complexity: O(n) where n is data size
- Best suited for bulk data encryption

4. USE CASES
------------
RSA (Asymmetric Cryptography):
✓ Digital signatures and authentication
✓ Key exchange (encrypting symmetric keys)
✓ Secure email (PGP/GPG)
✓ SSL/TLS handshake (key exchange phase)
✓ Small data encryption (passwords, tokens)
✓ Certificate-based authentication
✗ NOT suitable for encrypting large files directly
✗ NOT suitable for real-time data streaming

AES-256 (Symmetric Cryptography):
✓ Bulk data encryption (files, databases, disk encryption)
✓ Real-time data encryption (video streaming, VoIP)
✓ Database encryption
✓ File system encryption (BitLocker, FileVault)
✓ Secure communication channels (after key exchange)
✓ High-performance encryption requirements
✗ Requires secure key distribution mechanism
✗ Key management complexity in multi-party scenarios

5. PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM DEMONSTRATION
--------------------------------------------
From encrypting message.txt (approximately 300 bytes):

RSA Performance:
- File had to be split into multiple chunks (214 bytes each)
- Each chunk encrypted separately, resulting in larger encrypted file
- Slower processing due to multiple encryption operations
- Encrypted file size: Larger than original (due to chunking overhead)

AES-256 Performance:
- Entire file encrypted in a single operation
- Fast processing, minimal overhead
- Encrypted file size: Similar to original (with padding)
- Much faster execution time

6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------
RSA:
- Security depends on key size (2048-bit minimum recommended)
- Vulnerable to quantum computing (Shor's algorithm)
- Requires proper padding (OAEP recommended)
- Key pair must be generated securely

AES-256:
- Considered quantum-resistant (Grover's algorithm only halves security)
- Very secure when properly implemented
- Requires secure random key generation
- IV (Initialization Vector) must be unique for each encryption

7. HYBRID APPROACH (BEST PRACTICE)
-----------------------------------
In real-world applications, RSA and AES are often used together:

1. Generate a random AES-256 key
2. Encrypt the data with AES-256 (fast, efficient)
3. Encrypt the AES key with RSA public key (small data, fast)
4. Send both: RSA-encrypted AES key + AES-encrypted data

This combines the benefits of both:
- Fast bulk encryption (AES)
- Secure key distribution (RSA)
- No size limitations
- Optimal performance

8. SUMMARY
----------
RSA:
- Use for: Key exchange, digital signatures, small data
- Avoid for: Large file encryption, real-time streaming
- Performance: Slow for bulk data
- Key Management: Easier distribution

AES-256:
- Use for: Large files, bulk data, real-time encryption
- Avoid for: Direct key exchange (without secure channel)
- Performance: Fast for any data size
- Key Management: Requires secure distribution

CONCLUSION
----------
Both algorithms serve different purposes in modern cryptography:
- RSA excels at secure key exchange and authentication
- AES excels at efficient bulk data encryption
- Together, they form the foundation of secure communication systems

The demonstration clearly shows that AES-256 is significantly faster for file encryption,
while RSA is better suited for secure key exchange and small data encryption.
